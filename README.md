This is the GitHub page for our smartcar platform name _iCar_. We have explained different aspects of this platform and introduced various packages and software we have used to implement it. For any inquiries, feel free to contact the development team.

## What?


## Why?


## How?
We're working on two platforms, an Arduino car and a mobile application. For the Arduino car, we are going to create an Arduino sketch that holds the car's functions, and for the mobile application we are using Android Studio to create a simple UI. The communication between the car and the application will be easily done through MQTT broker in which the user _publish_ some commands through the App and the Arduino card _subscribe_ to those commands. Also, for some info like the camera feed and speed, this communication happens vice versa.
